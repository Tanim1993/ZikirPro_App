Got it! I’ve polished and organized your full idea—keeping every keyword and adding a few thoughtful, “room-focused” extras so a Replit dev can start right away.

# Islamic Zikir Competition App — End-to-End Plan

## 1) Core Concept

* **Zikir Amol** app with **digital tasbih** and a **leaderboard** (game-style) to run **zikir competition**.
* Users join **Zikir Rooms** and tap a **tasbih icon**; **count shows live** and rank moves **up/down live**.

## 2) Roles

* **User** (joins/creates rooms, zikir, profile).
* **Room Owner** (can invite/add/delete members, share room, set rules).
* **App Owner/Admin** (full control: view/delete rooms & users, BO moderation).

## 3) Zikir Room (the heart)

* **Create Room** (by app owner or any user):

  * **Zikir name**: dropdown + **search box** (from master Zikir list).
  * **Target count**: input or **unlimited**.
  * **Day count**: **1–40 days**.
  * **Remarks**: **Rules / description / fazilot / references**.
  * **Room picture** upload.
  * **Private/Public** toggle.
* **Join Room**:

  * Join with **nickname**.
  * See **current leaderboard**; after **Join**, **digital tasbih** appears.
* **Counting modes** (user can select type):

  * **Digital tasbih**, **manual tasbih**, **tap only**, etc.
* **Reset count**: allowed with **confirmation** popup.
* **Day-wise count**: separate button shows **daily history** for each user.
* **Top 3** highlighted with **crown** + pic; others listed below.
* **Room Owner tools**: **delete member / add member / invite member / share room**.
* **Public rooms**: anyone can **see & join**.

## 4) Home & Screens

1. **Home (after login)**

   * Shows **all zikir room** list (public + country wise + global).
   * **Create Room** button.
   * **Search** rooms by text.
   * **Progress dashboard**: position/rank, **streak count**, **spent time**, analytics (“you are better today **60%**”), **reminder** option (daily, time-wise).
2. **Room Screen (after join)**

   * Live **leaderboard** with **up/down** changes.
   * **Tasbih icon** (mode selector), **Reset (confirm)**, **Details** (shows **remarks/fazilot/references**).
   * **Day-wise count** view.
3. **Profile**

   * **Islamic avatar** (male/female, **7–8 types**) + profile pic.
   * **BG color** selection.
   * **Country** (select at entry; change in settings).
   * **Summary report**, **clear data**, **feedback / user experience** submission to owner.
4. **Zikir List**

   * All **zikir with fazilot** (from **backend/back office**).
   * **Select zikir → Create room** directly.

## 5) Leaderboards

* **Personal**, **Country**, **Worldwide** leaderboards.
* **Live show**: if anyone **cross/less**, rank updates **up/down** instantly.

## 6) Safety & Reporting

* Users can **report a room** or **report a user**.
* **App owner** can see reports in **BO or admin app** (recommend: **Back Office web portal** for better control), then **view/delete** rooms and users.

## 7) Country & Visibility

* Global app (worldwide base).
* On first entry user **selects country** (Bangladesh by default for you).
* **Country-wise rooms** and **Global rooms** both visible; **country can be changed** in settings.

## 8) Islamic UX vibe

* Clean **easy UI/UX**, Islamic theme (soft greens/golds).
* After completion, show **congratulations** like **“MashaAllah”** (with gentle animation/sound).

## 9) Reminders & Analytics

* **Daily reminders** (time-wise).
* **Analytics** on dashboard: streak, **spent time**, improvement % (“better today **60%**”).
* **Summary report** page; user can **clear data**.

## 10) Admin / Back Office (BO)

* Recommend **Back Office** web app for the owner:

  * Manage **Zikir master list** (fazilot, references).
  * **Rooms & members** (view, delete, lock).
  * **Reports** queue (room/user), decisions & notes.
  * **Country** and **visibility** controls.
  * **Analytics**: active rooms, counts, time spent, top countries.

## 11) Advanced (focused on Zikir Room—future-ready)

* **Anti-cheat**: tap-rate limits, server-side counting, debounce, suspicious-activity flags.
* **Offline counting** with later **sync** (signed & capped).
* **Seasonal competitions** (weekly/40-day **seasons**), **badges** for streaks.
* **Invite links/QR** to join private/public rooms.
* **Localization**: Bangla/English/Arabic; timezone-aware day boundaries.
* **Accessibility**: large tasbih, haptics/sound toggle.

## Developer handoff (for Replit)

**MVP scope (Phase 1):**

* Auth (email/phone).
* Country select.
* Zikir master list (seed).
* Create/Join **Zikir Room** with fields above.
* Live **leaderboard** + **digital tasbih** + reset confirm.
* Day-wise counts, top-3 crowns.
* Home dashboard (streak, time, % better).
* Profile (avatar picker 7–8 types, BG color).
* Report room/user.
* BO minimal: view/delete rooms, manage zikir list, handle reports.

**Suggested Stack (fast build):**

* **Flutter** (mobile) or React Native;
* **Realtime**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions) or Supabase;
* **Notifications**: FCM;
* **Admin BO**: React/Next.js (or Flutter Web) + Firebase.

**Key Data Models (high level):**

* `User(id, country, nickname, avatarType, bgColor, settings)`
* `Zikir(id, name, fazilat, references)`
* `Room(id, zikirId, ownerId, type, target, days, remarks, picture, country, startAt, endAt)`
* `RoomMember(roomId, userId, role, joinedAt)`
* `CountEntry(roomId, userId, day, delta, createdAt)`
* `Leaderboard(roomId, snapshotAt, ranks[])`
* `Report(id, type: room|user, targetId, byUserId, reason, status)`

**Core APIs/Functions (illustrative):**

* `POST /rooms` (create), `GET /rooms?country&global&search`
* `POST /rooms/{id}/join`
* `POST /rooms/{id}/count` (secure, server increments)
* `GET /rooms/{id}/leaderboard (live)` via websocket
* `POST /reports`
* Admin: `DELETE /rooms/{id}`, `PUT /zikir/{id}`, etc.

If you want, I can turn this into a one-page **PRD** or a **task checklist** for your Replit dev.
