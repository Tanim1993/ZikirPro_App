Perfect point 👌
You want the **app UI** itself to feel like a game (similar to **Ludo Star**) where users instantly see their **progress, coins, and levels** on the top bar. Let’s extend the BRD with this requirement:

### Islamic Gamification System (BO ↔ App Integration)

## 6. App UI Design Requirements

### 6.1 Top Bar (Ludo-Star Style)

* **Purpose:** Show user’s real-time game status (motivates progression).
* **Position:** Fixed at the top of the app home/dashboard screen.
* **Elements to Display (all values come from BO):**

  * ⭐ **XP Bar:** (e.g., 344/1200 XP) with a progress bar.
  * 🪙 **Coins/Points Balance** – pulled from BO.
  * 💎 **Special Currency/Rewards (if configured)** – e.g., gems, streak multipliers.
  * 🏅 **User Level** – current level number + title (e.g., Level 19 – “Devoted”).
  * 📸 **Profile Picture + Country Flag** (optional, configurable from BO).
  * 🎯 **Special Buttons/Badges:** e.g., “Mega Win”, “Top Streak”, “New Quest” (if enabled in BO).

### 6.2 Integration with BO

* **All numbers, limits, and labels must be fetched from BO.**
* BO controls:

  * Max XP for each level.
  * Currency icons, names, and conversion rules.
  * Whether special labels (“Mega Win”, “Ramadan Bonus”) are displayed.
* App displays exactly what BO defines, no local overrides.

---

### 6.3 Example Scenario (User View)

* Top bar shows:

  * ⭐ 344/1200 XP → progress bar (Level 19 – Devoted).
  * 🪙 318.2M Coins.
  * 💎 8226 Gems.
  * 🎖️ Badge: “Top 10 in 5 Competitions”.
* If BO admin updates reward → next refresh, numbers and badges change instantly.

---

### 6.4 User Motivation

* Always visible → encourages users to play more and level up.
* Works like a **spiritual scoreboard** for their Islamic practices.
* Tied to progression → if user tries to enter higher-level rooms, top bar itself reminds them of required XP/coins.

✅ **Summary Addition:**
The app must display a **Ludo-Star-style top bar** that reflects **all BO-defined game metrics (XP, Coins, Levels, Badges, Gems)** in real-time, motivating users to progress.

Do you want me to also **rename these items with Islamic-themed names** (e.g., Coins → Barakah Points, Gems → Noor Tokens, XP → Amal Score) so the UI matches the Islamic identity?
