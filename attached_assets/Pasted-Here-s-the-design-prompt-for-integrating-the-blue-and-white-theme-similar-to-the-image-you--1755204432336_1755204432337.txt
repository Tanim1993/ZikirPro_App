Here’s the **design prompt** for integrating the **blue and white theme** (similar to the image you uploaded) into your app, and allowing users to **choose and establish this theme** across all pages:

---

### **Feature: Blue & White Theme Integration + User Customization**

**Goal:**
Integrate a modern **blue & white theme** for your app, inspired by the image provided. Allow users to choose this theme across all app screens. The theme should be consistent across **Home**, **Prayer**, **Profile**, **Library**, and **Room screens**.

---

### **1. Color Palette**

* **Primary Colors**:

  * **Blue**: #1D4ED8 (for headers, buttons, active states)
  * **White**: #FFFFFF (background, card sections)
  * **Light Blue**: #EFF6FF (lighter backgrounds, subtle containers)
  * **Gray**: #D1D5DB (text color for subtle sections)
  * **Dark Blue**: #1E3A8A (for secondary action buttons and less prominent areas)
* **Secondary Colors**:

  * **Accent Green**: #10B981 (for success, confirmation, or positive actions)
  * **Accent Red**: #DC2626 (for alerts or errors)

---

### **2. UI Elements**

#### **Header Bar (Blue with white text)**

* The header should have a **deep blue** background (#1D4ED8), with **white text**.
* **Icons** in the header: White icons for navigation (e.g., back, menu, search).

#### **Navigation Bar (White with Blue Icons)**

* Background should be **white**, with icons and text in **blue** (#1D4ED8).
* Active page should have an **accent underline** or border in blue for clear navigation.

#### **Cards and Containers**

* **Background**: Keep most containers **white**, with subtle **light blue** shadows or borders to separate sections. This can be used for room lists, Quran challenge cards, etc.
* For action cards (e.g., buttons), use **solid blue** with **white text** or icons. When hovered or pressed, they change to a lighter blue or accent green.

#### **Button Styles**

* **Primary Buttons**: Blue background with white text.
* **Secondary Buttons**: White background with blue text and border.
* **Disabled Buttons**: Light gray background with gray text.

### **3. User Interface Components**

1. **Theme Toggle Option (For User Customization)**
   Provide a toggle option in **Settings** so users can choose between the blue & white theme and another potential default theme (e.g., light or dark mode).

   * The toggle should change the app’s primary color scheme and apply it across all pages.
   * The theme toggle can be located in the **Settings** > **Appearance** section. Users can choose to **apply this theme universally** or just for certain pages.

2. **User Customization Flow**:

   * Upon opening the app, offer a **prompt** that asks users if they want to **apply the blue and white theme**.
   * If they accept, this theme should be stored in their user settings and applied to all pages (rooms, leaderboard, profile, prayer schedule, etc.).
   * Save the user’s theme preference in their settings (using **local storage**, **profile preferences**, or **user settings API**).

3. **Navigation & Search Bars**:

   * **Search bar**: The search bar should have a **white background** with blue text/icons and a subtle blue underline when focused.
   * **Bottom Navigation Bar**: Keep the bottom nav bar **white** with blue icons, and the active page should show an **underline or accent blue**.

---

### **4. Typography**

* **Primary Text**: Use **dark gray/blue** for readability, with clear differentiation between headings and body text.
* **Secondary Text**: Use **lighter gray** or **subtle blue** text for less important elements (e.g., subheaders, dates).

  Example:

  * Headings: **Bold**, dark blue text
  * Body Text: Regular weight, dark gray/blue text
  * Small text: Light gray for less important details (e.g., timestamps, non-actionable items)

---

### **5. Implementing across Pages**

1. **Home Page**:

   * Header with blue background and white icons.
   * Display featured **rooms, reciters**, and **upcoming challenges** in card format with a subtle blue border or shadow effect.
   * The **Quran Engagement Time** section should use a **white background** with **blue and green highlights** for progress.

2. **Prayer Page**:

   * Clean white background with **blue** icons for prayer times.
   * Use blue text for prayer names and **light blue** for the countdown to the next prayer.

3. **Profile Page**:

   * Profile card with **blue accents** and **white background**.
   * Allow users to upload a **profile picture**, and apply the blue-white theme to their username and bio area.

4. **Library Page**:

   * Organize Quran-related content, **weekly programs**, or **donation options** in **blue-bordered cards** with **white backgrounds**.
   * Icons should be **blue** with hover effects (changing to green or darker blue on focus).

5. **Room Pages**:

   * For **competition rooms**, ensure that the **leaderboard** has a clean, blue-themed **header and progress bars**.
   * Display room details in **white cards** with blue borders and prize information clearly marked in **accent blue**.

### **6. Additional Considerations**

* **Consistency**: Ensure consistency across all pages and components. Use the **blue** and **white** theme for cards, buttons, modals, and headers.
* **Accessibility**: Make sure that color contrasts meet WCAG standards for readability (blue text on white background). Avoid overuse of blue that could lead to **visual fatigue**.
* **Performance**: Use **CSS Variables** for theming to make switching colors easy and efficient across the app. Consider **lightweight animations** or transitions (e.g., button hover) using **Tailwind’s transition classes** for smooth, subtle changes.
